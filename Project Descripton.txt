Online Railway Ticket Booking System(ORTBS) is a Web based and Android based application that works within a centralized network. The web application is developed using MEAN stack in which the Backend uses Express and NodeJs and I have done Frontend in Angular technology. This project presents a review on the software program Online Railway Ticket Booking System as should be used in a railway system, a facility which is used to booking seats, cancellation of booking and different types of train enquiries used on securing quick bookings. ORTBS is an Android and Web application in which I used Bootstrap to built an attractive webPage and JAVA to write Android side coding. This app maintains all user details, train details, ticket details,PNR enquiries,etc in MySQL database using Android APIs.
